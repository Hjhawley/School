Transport Layer

What transport service does an app need?

* data integrity - some apps require 100% reliable data transfer (file transfers)
    while others don't care as much (Zoom calls)

* throughput - some apps require a minimum amount of throughput to be effective
    (streaming movies and other multimedia)

* timing - some apps require low delay to be effective (online games)

* security - encryption, etc

RTT - round trip time
TTL - time to live

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the most well-known transport protocol
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) another commonly used one

TCP: reliable, congestion control, connection-oriented, does not provide timing, security
UDP: unreliable data transfer



  Application layer
^ Transport layer
^ Network layer (the overall web of connected systems)
^ Link layer (individual end-to-end software connections)
^ Physical layer (the hardware itself)

Each layer directly depends on the one below it, but it doesn't have to
    worry about the rest (abstraction)
