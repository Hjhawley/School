The Network Core: a mesh of interconnected routers
Packet-switching: hosts break application-layer messages into packets.



Network Core Functions

Forwarding (aka Switching)
A local action; move arriving packets from the router's input link
to the appropriate router output link.

Routing
A global action; determine source-destination paths taken by packets
using routing algorithms (think Djisktra's algorithm)



Packet-switching: store-and-forward
Packet transmission delay: takes L/R seconds to transmit (push out)
L-bit packet into link at R bps.
store and forward: entire packet must  arrive at router before it
can be transmitted on next link.

One-hop numerical example:
L = 10 Kbits
R = 100 Mbps
one-hop transmission delay = 0.1 msec

Queueing occurs when work arrives faster than it can be serviced

Packet queuing and loss: if arrival rate (in bps) to link exceeds
transmission rate (bps) of link for some period of time,
packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link and
packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) in router fills up



Nodal Delay
Each node has delay at processing, queue, transmission, and propagation
Dnodal = Dproc + Dqueue + Dtrans + Dprop
Processing - how long does it take for the software to receive & interpret data
Queue - how long does the data have to wait in line
Transmission - how long does it take to push the data through (limited by bandwidth)
Propagation - how long does it take for the data to travel (distance / speed of light)

"Faster internet" is really wider bandwidth. Bad "speeds" means low throughput /
transmission rate, but the data still moves at the speed of light
