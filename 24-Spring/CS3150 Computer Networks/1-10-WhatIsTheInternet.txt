The difference between a "client" and a "host" is just a matter of perspective
They both fetch and send to each other. Both are "end systems"

Modems, routers, switches, WiFi access points, etc are not end systems.
They're somewhere in the middle and they pass data along.


NUTS & BOLTS vs SERVICES

"Nuts & Bolts"

A collection of billions of devices interconnected by links
Protocols that define the format and the order of messages exchanged between
two or more communicating entities
("Protocol" - A rule which describes how an activity should be performed)

among network entities, and actions taken on message transmition & receipt

"Services"

Networks can be a CS thing, not just an IT thing!
