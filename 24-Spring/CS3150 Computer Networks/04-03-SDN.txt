SDN (software defined networking) control plane

Remote controller computes, installs forwarding tables in routers

Forwarding - sending the data along
Routing - deciding where to forward data

The Internet offers no QoS guarantee bandwidth, packet loss, order, timing
It gives its "best effort" and good enough is often good enough
SIMPLICITY OF MECHANISM has allowed the Internet to be widely deployed and
adopted. It's simple, so it works

Router architecture overview
DATA PLANE
    - Input & Output ports
    - High-speed switching fabric (composed of smaller things)
CONTROL PLANE
    - Routing processor

PoE: Power over Ethernet

Physical layer - bit-level reception
Link Layer - Ethernet
