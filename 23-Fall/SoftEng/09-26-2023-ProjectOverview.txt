Today is the first day of our "internship"
(Protip: don't take a CS internship without being paid)
On the first day of your job, you WILL be thrown into the deep end.
We should prepare for that feeling of being overwhelmed.

https://gitlab2450.cs.utahtech.edu/renquinn/youface
youface - get it running on your computer
^ It's a fake social media platform which will be the template for
our next group project.

Use pip to install flask, tinydb, and timeago
You can also just run this command inside the /youface directory:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you're having trouble, consider running a virtual environment
https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
It's tedious to set up but can be very helpful
Lets you install packages only to a single project and not your
entire machine.
Command to activate:
    source <venv>/bin/activate

Pretty much all software relies on other software which relies on
other software. It's a very unstable jenga tower

.gitignore
Tell git to ignore all files of certain types
You can have a global system-wide .gitignore for your home directory,
and a specific .gitignore for each particular project directory.

Run the server:
    python3 youface.py

Form a team of 2-5 members and fork a version of the youface project
