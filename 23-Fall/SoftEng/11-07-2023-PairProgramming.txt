Pair Programming

The "driver" holds the mouse and keyboard while the "navigator"
answers questions, catches mistakes, and makes suggestions
The driver handles small details, the navigator handles big picture

Be respectful, communicate, think ahead
Don't be a bossy "navigator", don't touch the keyboard if
you're not "driving". Respect the roles
Keep the conversation going, stay locked in
SWITCH ROLES OFTEN
