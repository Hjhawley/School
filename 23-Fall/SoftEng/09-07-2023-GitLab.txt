GitLab (and GitHub)

A remote data center that keeps track of your version history.
It also allows for collaboration.
Like Google Drive or Dropbox but significantly more powerful.

GitLab hasn't been around quite as long as GitHub but it's had
free private repositories for much longer. The company is entirely
remote and promotes working remotely whenever possible.

We read and write to the remote repository by "pushing" and "pulling".
The first time we pull a remote repository is called a "clone".

GENERATE A NEW SSH KEY
ssh -keygen
(Recommended to use the default name and don't enter a password)

ADD SSH KEY TO GITLAB
cat id_rsa.pub
This will give you the contents of the ssh key, copy and paste it in
GitLab to authorize it
