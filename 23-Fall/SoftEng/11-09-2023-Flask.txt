Flask & miscellaneous Python stuff for YouFace

A Python "Package" is essentially a directory (or folder) of Python files.
Each package in Python is a directory which MUST contain a special file
called __init__.py. This file can be empty, and it indicates that the
directory it resides in is a Python package, so its modules can be imported.

A "Decorator" starts with an @ sign. Think of it as tagging a function.
It's like a label or a mode indicating how a function will be used. They
can be thought of as wrappers that add additional functionality to the
existing code without changing its structure.

Web frameworks like Flask are the backend of a website, while HTML/CSS/JS
are the frontend (the stuff the user interacts with). Flask is for small
to medium projects. "Blueprints" are used for making components and
supporting common patterns within an app.

Jinja is a templating engine for Python (usually associated with Flask).
Used to generate HTML, allows the programmer to create a skeleton that
contains all the common elements of a website and defines blocks that
child templates can override.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format used to store simple data
structures and objects. It will consist of a bunch of maps (dictionaries)
and/or arrays (lists). Often used for sending data in web apps from the
server to the clients.

Cookies - tell the browser "hey, remember this". Small pieces of data
stored on the client's computer which remember useful information.

Sidenote: for our project specifically, we can encode images with base64
This will store binary image data as a base-64 string
