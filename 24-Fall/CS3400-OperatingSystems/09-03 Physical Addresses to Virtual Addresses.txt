This diagram shows how the xv6 operating system maps virtual addresses (left side)
to physical addresses (right side) on a RISC-V system.

Physical Addresses (Right Column)

    Physical Memory (RAM): The actual physical RAM in the computer, where the OS and applications store data and instructions. Virtual addresses map to specific locations in physical memory.

    Unused Regions: Areas of physical memory not currently used but reserved for future use.

    Device Mappings (VIRTIO, UART0, PLIC, CLINT): Fixed physical addresses for hardware devices, accessible via memory-mapped I/O.
        VIRTIO Disk: Virtual storage device.
        UART0: Serial communication port.
        PLIC: Manages hardware interrupts.
        CLINT: Handles timer interrupts.

    Boot ROM: The memory location where the CPU begins executing code during system boot.

Virtual Addresses (Left Column)

    MAXVA: The highest possible virtual address.
    Kernel Text (R-X): Contains the read-only and executable kernel code. This section is protected from modification.
    Kernel Data (RW-): Contains kernel data structures like process tables, which are both readable and writable.
    Free Memory (RW-): Unallocated memory available for OS use, writable as needed.
    Kstack 0, Kstack 1, etc.: Separate stacks for different processes, ensuring isolation between them.
    Guard Pages: Unused memory regions between stacks to prevent overflow and accidental data corruption.
    Trampoline: A small code section used during context switches to manage transitions between user mode and kernel mode.
    KERNBASE: Marks the start of the kernel's virtual address space.
    PHYSTOP: Indicates the end of the physical memory that the kernel can map.

Mapping Virtual to Physical Addresses

    Virtual addresses are translated to physical addresses by the memory management unit (MMU) using page tables. This ensures correct and secure memory usage.

Permissions (RWX)

    R-X (Read-Execute): For sections like kernel text, allowing execution and reading, but preventing modifications.
    RW- (Read-Write): For writable data sections like kernel data.
    RWX (Read-Write-Execute): Generally avoided in the kernel to prevent security vulnerabilities.
