Probabilistic Reasoning

Making rational decisions when the environment is:
	Partially observable
	Stochastic (non-deterministic)

Utility: the quantifiable effectiveness of an agent's actions.
As long as our actions are deterministic and fully observable, the utility of our actions can just be computed.
But in an unclear environment, we have to shoot for a Maximum Expected Utility (MEU)
