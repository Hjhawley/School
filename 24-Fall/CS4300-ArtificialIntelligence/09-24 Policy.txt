A search *policy* is a strategy or decision-making function that an agent follows in a given environment.
It defines the agent’s behavior by mapping states to actions.
More formally, it is a function ππ that takes a state ss as input and returns an action aa.

  You can think of a policy as a reflex table or lookup table, where for every possible state of
  the environment, the policy deterministically tells the agent what action to take.
  This table-based approach is common in environments where:
      The number of states is manageable or finite.
      The agent's task is discrete and has clear boundaries for states and actions.

  In such cases, for each state, the policy can explicitly define which action is best
  (or pre-determined) by storing them in a table or array.

  Deterministic Policy:
      In a deterministic policy, for every state ss, there is exactly one corresponding action aa.
      Given the state, the agent always chooses the same action.
      Example: π(s)=aπ(s)=a, where for a state ss, action aa is the only output.

  Policy Representation:
      Array-Based Representation: If the state space is discrete and small enough, the policy can
      be stored as an array where each index corresponds to a state, and the value at that index
      is the corresponding action to be taken.
          Example:
              Suppose the states are represented as integers from 0 to N−1N−1.
              We can create an array, policy[], where each element stores the action to take
              for that corresponding state.

              python

          policy = [a0, a1, a2, ..., aN-1]

          Here, policy[s] would give the action aa for the state ss.

General Approach to Building a Reflex Table (Policy Array):

  Initialize an array with size equal to the total number of states.
  For each state ss, store the appropriate action aa in the array.
      The action can be determined through different methods such as heuristics, a learning process
      (like Q-learning), or by pre-defining actions for each state.

Advantages:

  Simplicity: Policies represented as lookup tables are easy to understand and implement.
  Efficiency: Once the table is built, action selection is instantaneous (constant time) since the
  action for a given state is just a lookup operation.

Limitations:

  Scalability: This approach doesn’t scale well to environments with large or continuous state
  spaces because the size of the array grows with the number of states.
  Memory Usage: A policy table requires enough memory to store an action for every possible state.
  For environments with a large number of states, this can become impractical.
  Generalization: Reflex tables do not generalize well to unseen states since they only cover specific, pre-defined states.
