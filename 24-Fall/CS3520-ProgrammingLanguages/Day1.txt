Programming Languages

SMoL (Standard Model of Languages)

    SMoL refers to a conceptual framework or approach in the study and design of programming languages.
    It typically outlines the fundamental concepts and components that most programming languages share, such as syntax, semantics, types, and execution models.
    SMoL provides a standardized way to understand and compare different programming languages, focusing on the core principles that underpin language design and implementation.

Interpreters:

    Responsible for executing code in a high-level language by converting it into machine code or an intermediate representation.

Language Design Motivations

    New languages are often created to address specific needs or "itches."
    Understanding the problems a language was intended to solve is crucial.

Example: Rust

Primary Focus:

    Safety: Rust emphasizes memory safety, aiming to prevent common issues like:
        Buffer overflows (a typical problem in C).
        Dangling pointers.
        Reliance on garbage collection.

Comparison to Other Modern Languages:

    While languages like Python also prioritize safety, Rust offers:
        Low-level control over performance while still providing high-level convenience and safety guarantees.
        Memory safety without heavy runtime overhead: Rust ensures safety by preventing problems at compile time, not runtime.

How Rust Achieves Safety:

    Rust generates proofs that your code won't cause issues, ensuring that safety is built into the language from the ground up.
