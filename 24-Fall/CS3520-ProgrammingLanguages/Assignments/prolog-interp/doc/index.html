<html><head></head><body><h1>Solver</h1>

<p>In this step you should write the Prolog interpreter/solver as
described in the slides:</p>

<pre><code>function resolution(clause, goals, query):
    let sub = the MGU of head(clause) and head(goals)
    return (sub(tail(clause) concatenated with tail(goals)), sub(query))

function solve(goals, query)
    if goals is empty then succeed(query)
    else for each clause c in the program, in order
        if head(c) does not unify with head(goals) then do nothing
        else solve(resolution(c, goals, query))
</code></pre>

<p>We will change this a little and use the following Rust functions:</p>

<pre><code>fn resolution(subs: &amp;Vec&lt;Sub&gt;, clause: &amp;Clause, goals: &amp;Vec&lt;Term&gt;, query: &amp;Term) -&gt; (Vec&lt;Term&gt;, Term) {}
pub fn solve(program: &amp;Vec&lt;Clause&gt;, goals: &amp;Vec&lt;Term&gt;, query: &amp;Term) {}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that only <code>solve</code> needs to be public as it is called from
<code>main</code>.</p>

<p><code>subs</code> is a list of substitutions to be applied in order, i.e., as
new substitutions are found they are added to the end of the list.
This is built for you by the <code>mgu</code> function, which is provided. You
can use it by calling the <code>apply_subs</code> function, which takes a list
of substitutions and a <code>Term</code> and applies the substitutions to the
term.</p>

<p>Note that the structure is a little different than the slides:
<code>solve</code> checks to see if the head of the goal list and the head of
clause can be unified, and if so it passes the MGU (a substitution
list) to <code>resolution</code>, rather than having <code>resolution</code> re-create it
as in the pseudocode.</p>

<p>So here are the paramaters and return values for <code>resolution</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>subs</code>: a list of substitutions as provided by the <code>mgu</code>
function and used be <code>apply_subs</code></li>
<li><code>clause</code>: a single clause from the program/database that unifies
with the head of the goal list</li>
<li><code>goals</code>: the list of goals that <code>resolution</code> must update</li>
<li><code>query</code>: the query term used to collect substitions and present
results back to the user</li>
</ul>

<p>Return values:</p>

<ul>
<li>The updated goal list</li>
<li>The query with any new substitutions applied</li>
</ul>

<p>And here are the parameters to <code>solve</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>program</code>: the complete list of clauses that make up the
program database.</li>
<li><code>goals</code>: the current list of goals that need to be solved.</li>
<li><code>query</code>: the original query term, with substitutions applied
along the way.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use <code>make run</code> to invoke the interpreter. It will start by
having you type in the program database clauses, then when you enter
a blank line it will switch to accepting queries and calling <code>solve</code>
on them.</p>
