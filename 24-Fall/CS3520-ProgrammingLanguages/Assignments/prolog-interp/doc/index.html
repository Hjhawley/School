<html><head></head><body><h1>Parser</h1>

<p>Write a parser for a simple Prolog version. You should base the
structure of your parser on the parsers from other assignments.</p>

<p>Here is the grammar you should implement:</p>

<pre><code>term             -&gt; variable | atom ( termlist ) | atom
termlist         -&gt; term | term , termlist
clause           -&gt; fact | rule
fact             -&gt; term .
rule             -&gt; term :- termlist .
</code></pre>

<p>A few relevant details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have provided a complete tokenizer. See <code>main.rs</code> for its
definition.</p></li>

<li><p>The other types (Clause and Term) are defined in <code>main.rs</code> as
well.</p></li>

<li><p>The public interface (used by <code>main</code>) is the functions
<code>parse_clause</code> and <code>parse_query</code>. They each create a <code>Parser</code>
object and expect to call a method on it. Use these to figure
out what is required.</p></li>

<li><p><code>inputs/tests.input</code> gives a bunch of examples of clauses that
will need to parse. Make sure you understand how the grammar
relates to the inputs before you begin.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You may also find the slides for Prolog to be helpful for review.</p>
