Parser
======

Write a parser for a simple Prolog version. You should base the
structure of your parser on the parsers from other assignments.

Here is the grammar you should implement:

    term             -> variable | atom ( termlist ) | atom
    termlist         -> term | term , termlist
    clause           -> fact | rule
    fact             -> term .
    rule             -> term :- termlist .

A few relevant details:

*   I have provided a complete tokenizer. See `main.rs` for its
    definition.

*   The other types (Clause and Term) are defined in `main.rs` as
    well.

*   The public interface (used by `main`) is the functions
    `parse_clause` and `parse_query`. They each create a `Parser`
    object and expect to call a method on it. Use these to figure
    out what is required.

*   `inputs/tests.input` gives a bunch of examples of clauses that
    will need to parse. Make sure you understand how the grammar
    relates to the inputs before you begin.
