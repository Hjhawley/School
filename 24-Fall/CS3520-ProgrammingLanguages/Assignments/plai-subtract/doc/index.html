<p>The starter code for this assignment is the interpreter after adding
booleans (with a few other tweaks). Your job is to add subtraction
to the language.</p>

<h2>Changing how minus signs are tokenized</h2>

<p>The first step is to change how minus signs are tokenized and
parsed. Consider this simple expression:</p>

<pre><code>1 -5
</code></pre>

<p>The tokenizer will currently tokenize this into:</p>

<pre><code>[Number(1.0), Number(-5.0)]
</code></pre>

<p>but it should be equivalent to the expression:</p>

<pre><code>1 - 5
</code></pre>

<p>and tokenized as:</p>

<pre><code>[Number(1.0), Minus, Number(5.0)]
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>make</code> and you should see how <code>-4</code> is currently tokenized and
how it is expected to be tokenized going forward. Note that
<code>main.rs</code> now prints out the token list and the parsed AST before
evaluating each expression.</p>

<p>Start by adding a new <code>Token</code> variant called <code>Minus</code> in <code>parse.rs</code>.
Then modify the tokenizer to recognize a <code>-</code> character as a <code>Minus</code>
token (this will be very similar to how <code>+</code> is recognized as <code>Plus</code>)
and change the number tokenizer so it no longer recognized the <code>-</code>
character.</p>

<p>Run <code>make</code> to see that it is now tokenized correctly but still
cannot parse it.</p>

<h2>Changing how minus signs are parsed</h2>

<p>Now update the parser. The grammar for terms is given in a comment
in <code>parse.rs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// term             -&gt; ( expression ) | conditional | number | bool
</code></pre>

<p>Change it to be:</p>

<pre><code>// term             -&gt; ( expression ) | conditional | - number | number | bool
</code></pre>

<p>and then update how <code>parse_term</code> is implemented to match the change
in the grammar: add a case for the <code>Minus</code> token that parses a
number <code>n</code> and returns <code>-n</code>. This essentially makes <code>-</code> a unary
prefix operator (to negate a number), but we handle the negation
directly in the parser.</p>

<p>Run <code>make</code> and it should succeed until <code>-</code> is used to mean
subtraction.</p>

<h2>Adding a Minus expression type</h2>

<p>Add a <code>Minus</code> expression variant in <code>main.rs</code> that mimics the
structure of <code>Plus</code>. Update the rest of the parser (including the
grammar definition in the comments) and the evaluator to support the
new expression type.</p>

<p>Note: subtraction should be left associative and have the same
precedence as addition, which will also be the most straightforward
way to implement it.</p>
