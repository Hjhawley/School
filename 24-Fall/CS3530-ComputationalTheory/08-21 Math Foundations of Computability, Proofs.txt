Computational Models:

    Finite Automata:
        Head scans left to right.
        Checks simple patterns.
        Uses finite table lookup.
        Cannot count without a limit.

    Pushdown Automata:
        Finite control plus a stack.
        Uses stack for counting and balancing parentheses.
        Can check many syntax rules.

    Turing Machine:
        Finite control with a head that moves left and right.
        Can read and write.
        Equivalent to a modern computer.

Set Theory:

    Sets: Defined by their members. A = B means every element in A is also in B, and vice versa.
    Cardinality: Sets can be finite or infinite. The empty set has a cardinality of zero.
    Subsets: A ⊆ B means every element in A is also in B.

Functions:

    A function maps an input to an output, consistently producing the same output for the same input.
    Domain and Range: The domain is the set of possible inputs, and the range is the set of possible outputs.
    Injective (1-1): Each element of the domain maps to a unique element of the range.
    Surjective (Onto): Every element of the range has a corresponding element in the domain.
    Bijective: A function that is both injective and surjective.

Set Operations:

    Union (A ∪ B): Combines all elements of A and B.
    Intersection (A ∩ B): Elements common to both A and B.
    Complement (Ā): Elements not in A.
    Difference (A - B): Elements in A that are not in B.
