Proofs:

    A proof is a formal argument demonstrating the truth of a mathematical statement.
    Formal Argument:
        Successive statements are clear and unambiguous.
        The steps are logically interconnected.
        The argument could, in theory, be checked by a machine.

Purpose of Proofs:

    Certainty: To be absolutely certain that a statement is true.
    Example: Proving there is no fast correct algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) would confirm that continued searching is futile.
    Understanding: To understand why a statement is true, which helps in determining if it can be extended or restricted.
    Problem Solving: The steps in the proof can provide insights into solving related problems.

Example Proof:

    Prove that the negation of (A ∪ B) is a subset of the negation of A ∩ the negation of B
        Let p be a member of ¬(A ∪ B)
        p ∈ ¬(A ∪ B)
        p ∉ (A ∪ B)
        p ∉ A and p ∉ B
        p ∈ ¬A and p ∈ ¬B
        Therefore, p ∈ ¬A ∩ ¬B
        
        Now we need to prove the other side.
        
        Let q be any member of ¬A ∩ ¬B
        q ∈ ¬A ∩ ¬B
        q ∈ ¬A and q ∈ ¬B
        q ∉ A and q ∉ B
        q ∉ (A ∪ B)
        Any member of ¬A ∩ ¬B is also a member of ¬(A ∪ B)
        Because ¬A ∩ ¬B ⊆ ¬(A ∪ B)
        and ¬(A ∪ B) ⊆ ¬A ∩ ¬B,
        ¬A ∩ ¬B = ¬(A ∪ B)
    This is the complete proof.
