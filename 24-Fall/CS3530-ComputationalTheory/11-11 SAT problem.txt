Theorem 7.31
If A ≤P B and B ∈ P, then A ∈ P.

Proof: Let M be the polynomial time decider for B and f be the
polynomial time reduction from A to B.
Let N = “On input w:
    1. Compute f (w).
    2. Run M on input f (w) and output whatever M outputs.”
Is w ∈ A ⇔ f (w) ∈ B?
Is N polynomial time?

A ≤P B
    Describe a generic instance of A.
    Describe a generic instance of B.
    Provide the polynomial time reduction function.
    Prove the function is polynomial time computable.
    Prove that any instance of A can be reduced to some instance of B.
    Prove that any non-instance of A can be reduced to some non-instance of B.
    (Alternatively: Prove that any reachable instance of B can be only be reduced from some instance of A.)
    Conclude that the conditions of polynomial time mapping reduction have been met.
