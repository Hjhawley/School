Alphabets and Strings:

    Alphabet (∑): A finite, non-empty set of symbols.
    String: A finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet.
    Empty String (ε): A string with no symbols, denoted by ε.
    Set of All Strings (∑*): The set of all possible strings over an alphabet ∑, including the empty string.

String Operations:

    Length of a String (|x|): The number of symbols in the string.
    Concatenation: Joining two strings x and y to form a new string (e.g., if x = "aa" and y = "b", then xy = "aab").
    Reversal: The reverse of a string x is denoted by x^R (e.g., if x = "abc", then x^R = "cba").

Languages:

    Language (L): A set of strings over an alphabet, which can be finite or infinite. Languages do not require a discernible pattern.
    Language as a Subset: A language L is a subset of ∑*.
    Kleene Star (*): A set operation producing all possible strings by concatenating any number of symbols from the original set (e.g., {aa}* = {ε, aa, aaaa, ...}).

Special Symbols:

    ε: The empty string.
    ∅: The empty set.
    The concatenation of the empty set ∅ with any other set results in ∅.
