Turing Machine: like a DFA with an infinite tape

Configuration: a way to see the current processing state

What do we mean by 'accept'?
if there is a sequence of configurations that follow the transition funcs such that we enter the accept state 

What do we mean by 'halt'?
A machine that accepts or rejects a string eventually, doesn't loop infinitely

Turing-recognizable
Turing-decidable

Implementation-level descriptions
The "assembly language" of Turing machines so to speak

High-level descriptions
A more abstract, less tedious description that still doesn't obscure important details
