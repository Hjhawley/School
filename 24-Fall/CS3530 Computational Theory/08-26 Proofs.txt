Proofs

A proof is a formal argument of the truth og some mathematical starement
formal means that the successive statements are unambiguous, and the steps interlock in a logical vise grip
formal also means that the argument could in principle be put in syntax that a machine could check

Why do we do proofs?

To be absolutely sure that the statement is true
for example it is commonly believed there is no fast correct algorithm for the TSP, but until someone PROVES it we wont know to stop looking
To understand why iy is true, so we can tell whether it can be extended or restricted and still remain rtrue
So we can solve a problem associated with the proposition. The proof steps themselves give us insight into the problem.

For example:

Prove that the negation of (A ∪ B) is a subset of the negation of A ∩ the negation of B
Let p be any member of ¬(A ∪ B)
p ∈ ¬(A ∪ B)
p ∉ (A ∪ B)
p ∉ A and p ∉ B
p ∈ ¬A and p ∈ ¬B
Therefore, p ∈ ¬A ∩ ¬B
Now we need to prove the other side.
Let q be any member of ¬A ∩ ¬B
q ∈ ¬A ∩ ¬B
q ∈ ¬A and q ∈ ¬B
q ∉ A and q ∉ B
q ∉ (A ∪ B)
Any member of ¬A ∩ ¬B is also a member of ¬(A ∪ B)
Because ¬A ∩ ¬B ⊆ ¬(A ∪ B)
and ¬(A ∪ B) ⊆ ¬A ∩ ¬B,
¬A ∩ ¬B = ¬(A ∪ B)

This is our complete proof.
