Alphabets are a finite but non-empty set of symbols, usually denoted by ∑
Strings are a finite numver of symbols joined together in a sequence
Empty string denoted by ε
∑* is the set of ALL strings over alphabet ∑
    For ex: {a,b}* = {ε,a,b,aa,ab,ba,bb,aaa...}
The length of a string x is written as |x|
    |abba| = 4 
    |ab| = 2
    |ε| = 0

Concantenation of strings
    written as x • y or just xy
    x = aa, y = b → xy = aab
Reversal of a string is a superscripted R
    x = abc → x^R = cba

A language L over some alphabet ∑ is a set of strings over ∑
    L ⊆ ∑*
    A language can be finite or infinite and does not require a discernible pattern.
    Any YES/NO problem can be cast as a language.
    Ex: the set of strings x ∈ {a,b}* such that x has an even number of a's.

ε the empty STRING
∅ the empty SET

The concatenation of the empty set ∅ with any other set is ∅ (it's like multiplying by zero)

Kleene star *
A set operation meaning all strings that can be produced by concatenating any number of symbols from the original language.
    {aa}* = {ε,aa,aaaa,...}

Alphabet ∑: A finite set of symbols.
String: A finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet.
    Empty String ε
Language L: A set of strings over an alphabet, which can be finite or infinite.
Set: A collection of distinct elements, which in this context typically refers to strings or symbols.
    Empty Set ∅ = {}
