Element of ∈
    The item is inside the set.
Not an Element of ∉
    The item is not inside the set.
Negation ¬
    Inverts the truth value of a statement.
Cardinality |𝐴|
    The size or count (the number of elements in set 𝐴).
Union ∪
    The union of two sets includes all elements that are in either set or in both. Think of it as combining the sets together.
Intersection ∩
    The intersection of two sets includes only the elements that are in both sets.
Subset ⊆
    A set 𝐴 is a subset of set 𝐵 if all elements of 𝐴 are also in 𝐵. 𝐴 can be the same as 𝐵 or smaller.
Superset ⊇
    A set 𝐵 is a superset of set 𝐴 if it contains all elements of 𝐴. 𝐵 can be the same as 𝐴 or larger.
Proper Subset ⊂
    A set 𝐴 is a proper subset of set 𝐵 if all elements of 𝐴 are in 𝐵, and 𝐴 is strictly smaller (not equal to 𝐵).
Proper Superset ⊃
    A set 𝐵 is a proper superset of set 𝐴 if it contains all elements of 𝐴, and 𝐵 is strictly larger (not equal to 𝐴).
Empty Set ∅
    A set with no elements, like an empty box.
Cartesian Product ×
    The Cartesian product of two sets 𝐴 and 𝐵 is the set of all ordered pairs where the first element is from 𝐴 and the second is from 𝐵.
Power Set 𝒫(A)
    The power set of a set 𝐴 is the set of all possible subsets of 𝐴, including the empty set ∅ and 𝐴 itself.
Complement of a Set Ā
    The set of all elements not in 𝐴. Equivalent to ¬𝐴.
Difference of Sets 𝐴 \ 𝐵
    The set of elements in 𝐴 that are not in 𝐵.
Symmetric Difference ⊕ or ⊖
    The set of elements in either 𝐴 or 𝐵 but not in both.
Universal Set 𝕌
    The set containing all possible elements under consideration, often used in the context of complements.
Natural Numbers ℕ
    The set of all natural numbers, starting from 1.
Integers ℤ
    The set of all integers, including positive, negative, and zero.
Rational Numbers ℚ
    The set of all numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.
Real Numbers ℝ
    The set of all real numbers, including all rational and irrational numbers.
Complex Numbers ℂ
    The set of all complex numbers, including the imaginary unit i.
