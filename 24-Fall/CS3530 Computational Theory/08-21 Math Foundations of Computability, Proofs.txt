What is a computer? First try a "mathematical automaton".

Finite Automata
    Head scans left to right
    Check simle patterns
    Finite table lookup
    Can't count without limit

Pushdown Automata
    Finite control + stack
    Uses stack to count, balance parentheses
    Check many syntax rules

Turing Machine
    Control is still finite
    Head moves left AND right
    Can read AND write
    Basically equivalent to a modern computer

Sets are defined by their members.
A = B means that for every x, x ∈ A iff x ∈ B.
"iff" = "if and only if"

Cardinality - sets can be finite or infinite 
The empty set 0 has cardinality zero

A subset is a set whose members are contained in another set.
A ⊆ B means that for every x, x ∈ A ⇒ x ∈ B.
{1,3,5,7...} ⊆ W    This set is a subset of all whole numbers
{0,2,4,6...} ⊄ N    This set is NOT a subset of all natural numbers

Functions are central to mathematics. A function is an object that sets up an
input–output relationship. A function takes an input and produces an output.
In every function, the same input always produces the same output. If f is a
function whose output value is b when the input value is a, we write

f (a) = b.

A function also is called a mapping, and, if f (a) = b, we say that f maps a to b.
For example, the absolute value function abs takes a number x as input and
returns x if x is positive and −x if x is negative.
Thus abs(2) = abs(−2) = 2.
Addition is another example of a function, written add. The input to the 
addition function is an ordered pair of numbers, and the output is the sum of
those numbers.
The set of possible inputs to the function is called its domain. The outputs 
of a function come from a set called its range. The notation for saying that f is
a function with domain D and range R is

f : D−→R.

In the case of the function abs, if we are working with integers, the domain and 
the range are Z, so we write abs : Z−→Z. In the case of the addition function 
for integers, the domain is the set of pairs of integers Z×Zand the range is Z,
so we write add : Z× Z−→ Z. Note that a function may not necessarily use all 
the elements of the specified range. The function abs never takes on the value
−1 even though −1 ∈Z. A function that does use all the elements of the range 
is said to be onto the range

Alternative common terminology for these types of functions is injective for
one-to-one, surjective for onto, and bijective for one-to-one and onto.

Injective ("1-1"): every member of S is mapped to some member of T 
Surjective ("Onto"): every member of T has some member of S mapped to it
Bijective : 1-1 AND onto; correspondence

The union of A and B, written A ∪ B, is the set we get by combining all the elements in A and B into a single set.
The intersection of A and B, written A ∩ B, is the set of elements that are in BOTH A and B.
The complement of A, written Ā, is the set of all elements under consideration that are NOT in A.
A - B means "everything in A that is NOT in B"
