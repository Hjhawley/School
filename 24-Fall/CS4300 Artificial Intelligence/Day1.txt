Artificial Intelligence

Course Overview:
    Introduces the broad field of artificial intelligence in computer software followed by specific applications in computer gaming strategies.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:
    Construct solutions for a range of problems using search algorithms.
    Infer problems that can be solved using propositional logic and build appropriate solutions.
    Design and implement Bayesian networks.
    Integrate third-party libraries into solutions for large software projects.
    Collaborate to solve large and complex problems.

We will definitely cover planning & searching agents, NLP, and LLMs. Probably won't cover ML or CV.

Assignments and Exams:
    No exams; assignments due every week Thursday morning before class

WHAT IS AI?
    The term encompasses lots and lots of things.
    Some of the biggest fields and terms:
    Recently "machine learning" ML has gotten a lot of attention and most people assume that's what AI is,
    but really it's just a part of it.
    Large language models LLMs are especially in the public eye. LLMs are trained WITH machine learning techniques
    ChatGPT is powered by an LLM.
    Natural language processing NLP is when text (or voice commands) are processed and turned into commands.
    Siri is an example of this.
    Image processing / computer vision CV is also a branch of AI and is trained with ML.
    OCR is also part of this.
    An "agent" is an entity with an objective to accomplish.
    Outside of agentic AI you have "planning & searching", which encompasses things like video game "AIs."
    These might have super rudimentary hard-coded functions compared to the complex capabilities of ML powered agents.

HUMAN-LIKE  * Limited by biochemistry, physiology, emotions     * Can pass the Turing Test (Natural conversation)
            * Memory limitations                                * Makes decisions
            * Maybe defined by principles of psychology?        * Not optimal
            * We probably don't want this!

RATIONAL    * Actions -> consequences                           * Comes to rational decisions and acts on them 
            * "proof"                                           * THIS IS OUR GOAL 
            * Math, logic, probabilities, statistics

Intelligent agents

Agent / environment model

    The environment is everything outside of the agent that it perceives.
    For a self-driving car it's the road and weather conditions it can sense. For an LLM it's the user's input.
    An agent has sensors to perceive, an agent function to process information, and actuators to perform actions.
    A "percept" is something that an agent perceives. Percept is an abstraction, sensors are concrete.
    Ex: "the car in front of me tapped its brakes" is a percept we want the agent to recognize.
    The actuator is the concrete system that completes a more abstract action.
    "I want to move forward" is an action. The actuator is what depresses the gas pedal.
    The agent function decides to move and tells the actuator it wants to move, the actuator does the moving.

    Rationality:
        Performance measure - how well is the agent performing its task? Must be judged against something
        Prior knowledge
        Possible actions
        Percept sequence
    
    PEAS assessment:
        Performance - client or stakeholders must agree to a performance measure so the agent does what they want
        Environment - must understand all aspects of the environment as it pertains to the objective
        Actuators - what tools are available for the agent to use?
        Sensors - what tools are available for the agent to use?
