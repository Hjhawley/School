Artificial Intelligence

Course Overview:
    Introduces the broad field of artificial intelligence in computer software followed by specific applications in computer gaming strategies.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:
    Construct solutions for a range of problems using search algorithms.
    Infer problems that can be solved using propositional logic and build appropriate solutions.
    Design and implement Bayesian networks.
    Integrate third-party libraries into solutions for large software projects.
    Collaborate to solve large and complex problems.

We will definitely cover planning & searching agents, NLP, and LLMs. Probably won't cover ML or CV.

Assignments and Exams:
    No exams; assignments due every week Thursday morning before class

WHAT IS AI?
The term encompasses lots and lots of things.
Some of the biggest fields and terms:
Recently "machine learning" ML has gotten a lot of attention and most people assume that's what AI is,
but really it's just a part of it.
Large language models LLMs are especially in the public eye. LLMs are trained WITH machine learning techniques
ChatGPT is powered by an LLM.
Natural language processing NLP is when text (or voice commands) are processed and turned into commands.
Siri is an example of this.
Image processing / computer vision CV is also a branch of AI and is trained with ML.
OCR is also part of this.
An "agent" is an entity with an objective to accomplish.
Outside of agentic AI you have "planning & searching", which encompasses things like video game "AIs."
These might have super rudimentary hard-coded functions compared to the complex capabilities of ML powered agents.

            THINK                                               ACT

HUMAN-LIKE  Limited by biochemistry, physiology, emotions       Can pass the Turing Test (Natural conversation)
            Memory limitations                                  Makes decisions (not always optimal)
            Maybe defined by principles of psychology?
            We probably don't want this!

RATIONAL    Actions -> consequences                             Comes to rational decisions and acts on them 
            "proof"                                             THIS IS OUR GOAL 
            Math, logic, probabilities, statistics
