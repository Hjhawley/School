    Construct solutions for a range of problems using search algorithms.
    Infer problems that can be solved using propositional logic and build appropriate solutions.
    Design and implement Bayesian networks.
    Integrate third-party libraries into solutions for large software projects.
    Collaborate to solve large and complex problems.

Topics Covered:
    Planning & Searching Agents
    Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    Large Language Models (LLMs)
Probably Not Covered:
    Machine Learning (ML)
    Computer Vision (CV)

Grading:
    Assignments are due every week on Thursday morning before class.
    No exams in this course.

What is AI?

    The term "AI" covers a wide range of fields and techniques.
    Key Areas:
        Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that has recently gained significant attention. It's often mistaken as the entirety of AI.
        Large Language Models (LLMs): A specific application of ML that powers systems like ChatGPT. LLMs are currently in the public eye.
        Natural Language Processing (NLP): Processes text or voice commands into actionable instructions. Siri is an example.
        Computer Vision (CV): Another branch of AI that involves image processing, often trained using ML techniques. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is part of CV.
        Agents: Entities with objectives, ranging from simple, hard-coded video game AIs to complex ML-powered systems.

AI Framework: Thinking and Acting

    Human-Like AI:
        Thinking:
            Limited by human biochemistry, physiology, and emotions.
            Subject to memory limitations.
            Possibly defined by psychological principles.
        Acting:
            Capable of natural conversation (e.g., passing the Turing Test).
            Makes decisions, though not always optimal.
            Note: Human-like AI is not necessarily the desired goal.

    Rational AI (Our Goal):
        Thinking:
            Considers actions and their consequences.
            Relies on proof, using mathematics, logic, probabilities, and statistics.
        Acting:
            Makes rational decisions and acts on them.

Intelligent Agents

    Agent/Environment Model:
        The environment is everything outside the agent that it perceives. For example, a self-driving car's environment includes the road and weather conditions, while an LLMâ€™s environment includes user input.
        An agent has:
            Sensors to perceive the environment.
            An agent function to process information.
            Actuators to perform actions.
        A percept is something that an agent perceives (e.g., "the car in front of me tapped its brakes"). A percept is an abstraction, while sensors are concrete.
        Action: The decision to perform a task, which is executed by an actuator (e.g., "I want to move forward" leads to the actuator depressing the gas pedal).
        The agent function decides what action to take and instructs the actuator to execute it.

    Rationality:
        Performance Measure: Evaluates how well the agent is performing its task, compared against a standard or goal.
        Prior Knowledge: What the agent knows before acting.
        Possible Actions: The options available to the agent.
        Percept Sequence: The sequence of perceptions that informs the agent's decisions.

    PEAS Assessment:
        Performance: The client or stakeholders must agree on a performance measure to ensure the agent meets their objectives.
        Environment: The agent must understand all relevant aspects of the environment to achieve its objective.
        Actuators: The tools available to the agent to perform actions.
        Sensors: The tools available to the agent to perceive the environment.
