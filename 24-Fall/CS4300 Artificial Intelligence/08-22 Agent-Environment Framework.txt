Agent-Environment Framework

The environment is the setting that the agent is interacting with
in order to solve some sort of problem that exists in that environment.

The agent receives percepts through sensors, which we will abstract away for the sake of this class.
The agent function handles decision-making.
The agent uses actautors to affect the environment.

Performance: The client or stakeholders must agree on a performance measure to ensure the agent meets their objectives.
Environment: The agent must understand all relevant aspects of the environment to achieve its objective.
Actuators: The tools available to the agent to perform actions.
Sensors: The tools available to the agent to perceive the environment.

Environment Properties:
    Observability (fully vs partial) ex: a chess bot has a fully observable environment; a bot playing a strategy game with fog of war has only partial visibility.
    Deterministic vs non Deterministic (Stochastic) - refers to the effects of the agent's actions. in chess, a move is completely deterministic; a legal move will always behave the same way. However, if it's a ROBOT moving a physical chess piece in the real world, there is some non-determinism; what if the piece got dropped?
    Episodic vs sequential - episodic is when every agent action is isolated in a single instance. sequential is when the agent recevies more information in the same instance of the environment after each action.
    static vs dynamic - does the environment change or not *when the agent isn't doing anything*? ex: a chess board is static, a road is dynamic.
    discrete vs continuous - integers vs decimal numbers.
    single vs multiple agent - how many agents are in the environment? ex: chess is a 2-agent environment. You could also just consider these part of the dynamic environment.
    known vs unknown - "what does this button do?" the agent might need to do some "button mashing" to learn what does what. Account for unknowns when describing an environment

Ideal environment for ease of development: fully observable, deterministic, episodic, static, discrete, single-agent, with known variables. We try to abstract environments into this state when we can.
Obviously, this isn't always possible, but we try.

Rationality should be measured as the average performance measure of an agent over a large number of instances from an environment class.
