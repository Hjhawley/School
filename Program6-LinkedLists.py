# Linked Lists
'''
Create a container class for storing unordered unique Students.
It should support the methods: Exists, Insert, Traverse, Delete, Retrieve, and Size.
Implement the methods using a LinkedList.
Repeat the previous assignment using your new LinkedList container class,
and compare the Insert, Traverse, Delete, and Retrieve times to the pythonList.
Verify that the average ages and the error messages are the same.
Note that your main function should be much simpler than it was when you used a python list, because your LinkedList class automatically enforces uniqueness.
