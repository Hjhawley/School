DESTRUCTORS are never called; they're handled automatically. 
The programmer's job is to just know when they occur.
This is how we manually do what "garbage collection" does

Difference between a reference and a pointer

Good practices - as soon as you use a "new", figure out when you're going to use the destructor
This will help avoid memory leaks

To delete a pointer:
if(mPtr != 0) {     // If it's not a null pointer, it needs to be deleted
    delete mPtr;    // Delete the pointer
    mPtr = 0;       // To be extra safe, set it to a null pointer
}
