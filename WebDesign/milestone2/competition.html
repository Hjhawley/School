        <p>What other car detailing websites do well is incorporate Google reviews and include before-and-after photos.</p>
        <p>However, they also tend to use unappealing and cheap-looking colors, and they also poorly utilize space.
          The information is not very compact and the user has to scroll quite a ways just to find basic information.</p>
        <p>I could improve on their example by fitting all of the most necessary information onto the screen without creating clutter.
          I will also use a more reserved, clean, professional color palette. I will use photos to grab the user's attention rather than loud colors.</p>
