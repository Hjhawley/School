///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

blobs, trees, & commits - three types of data that Git manages

blob - a file containing text or binary data
tree - a directory / folder, holds blobs or other trees
commit - a snapshot of tracked changes

"SHA" - a unique hash referring to a commit
"ref" (reference) - a pointer to keep track of specific commits
    branches - a fork of the project with its own history of changes
    tags - a human-readable label for a SHA hash
    HEAD - the version / commit you're viewing in your local repo

"master"/"main" - the original and default branch of a project where priority
    changes are committed

"issues"/"tickets" - problems or to-do items

git fetch origin - retrieves updates from the remote repository named 'origin'
    but does not merge or modify your working directory, unlike git pull
    which fetches and then merges
