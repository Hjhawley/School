ASCII

For our 700x1000.ppm image file:

od -c 700x1000.ppm | less       // Interpret as ascii characters when possible
od -t u1 700x1000.ppm | less    // Interpret as unsigned integers

od ("octal dump") is a unix command that dumps the contents of a
file in whatever format you ask it to.

#include <fstream>
// A file stream

Variables must be declared and named
std::ofstream bits("bit-patterns.txt"); // This file is created with this command

ofstream is a sequence of data associated with the file

One method of any o-stream class is "write" which finds a particular
array of bytes and appends it to the end of the stream

unsigned char byte;
byte = (unsigned char)i;
&byte;  // A computation; the memory address of this particular variable
        // & is a pointer to the memory location
bits.write((char *)&byte, 1);
