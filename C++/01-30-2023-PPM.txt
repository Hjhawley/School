PPM Image Format: a text header followed by binary data

P6 WIDTH HEIGHT MAX_COLOR_VALUE\n
BINARY REPRESENTATION OF COLORS FOR EACH PIXEL

{
    os << "P6" << " " << width << " " << height << " " << maxColorValue << "\n";

    for(row) {
        for(col) {
            unsigned char c = getChannel(row, col, 0);
            os.write((char *) &c, sizeof(c));           // Treat this as a character, not an int
            c = getChannel(row, col, 1);
            os.write((char *) &c, sizeof(c));
            c = getChannel(row, col, 2);
            os.write((char *) &c, sizeof(c));
        }
    } 
}

PPM::writestream is sending text to a file, NOT to the terminal for the user to read

Be sure to correctly set a new max color value, or the image will be mostly black

Python Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs

C++ equivalent is a Map

std::map<std::string, int>  // This map uses strings as keys and ints as values
Trying to use an int as a string will result in a syntax error

favPrime["Hayden"] = 7;    // Written just like in Python
If the key doesn't exist, it's created. If it does, its value is overwritten.

int x = favPrime["Hayden"]

Sidenote:
"a string literal in C++ uses double quotes"
'a character literal in C++ uses single quotes'
