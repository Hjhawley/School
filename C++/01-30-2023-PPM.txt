PPM Image Format: a text header followed by binary data

P6 WIDTH HEIGHT MAX_COLOR_VALUE\n
BINARY REPRESENTATION OF COLORS FOR EACH PIXEL

{
    os << "P6" << " " << width << " " << height << " " << maxColorValue << "\n";

    for(row) {
        for(col) {
            unsigned char c = getChannel(row, col, 0);
            os.write((char *) &c, sizeof(c));           // Treat this as a character, not an int
            c = getChannel(row, col, 1);
            os.write((char *) &c, sizeof(c));
            c = getChannel(row, col, 2);
            os.write((char *) &c, sizeof(c));
        }
    } 
}

PPM::writestream is sending text to a file, NOT to the terminal for the user to read

Be sure to correctly set a new max color value, or the image will be mostly black
