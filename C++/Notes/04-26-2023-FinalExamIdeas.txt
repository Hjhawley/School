Filters
PPM -> [filter] -> PPM
including orange filter, grayscale, PPM operators, etc
* Edge detection filter: identify bright pixels with dim neighboring pixels
If the overall change in two neighboring pixels is high, make one output pixel bright
if they are similar, the produced output pixel is dim.

* Anti-aliasing: average neighboring pixels and smooth out sharp edges
First option - resize to quarter size, and average colors per 4-pixel block
Second option - similar to edge detection; use a block of 4 pixels to determine
one output pixel (located in the top-left corner of the block)

* Load input image 1 from the GUI and apply a filter, like grayscale
[inside createFractal() copy output image to input image 1?]

* New fractal type
