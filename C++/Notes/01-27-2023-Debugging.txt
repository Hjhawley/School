Debugging

[copy from notes]

Use std::cout to print variables and find errors
Comment them out when they're no longer needed, delete when program is finished

A higher-level way:

### Debugging flag
CXXFLAGS := $(CXXFLAGS) -g

gdb - GNU debugger

Lets you observe the value of variables as they execute

gdb ./filename

(gdb) run - run until it crashes or finishes
(gdb) break main - if the main() function is called, pause execution
(gdb) list - show the source code
(gdb) continue - to keep going
(gdb) next - execute the next statement in the program
(gdb) print x - display the value of any variable
(gdb) where - show the current call stack
(gdb) up - move up the call stack
(gdb) down - move down the call stack
(gdb) q - quit
