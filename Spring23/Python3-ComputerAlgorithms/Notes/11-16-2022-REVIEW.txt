Explain the difference between P, NP, and NP-Complete.
NP is non-polynomial, NP-Complete means other problems can be mapped to it.

Convert from infix to postfix:
1 * 2 / (3 + 4 * (5 + 6 - 7) / 8) - 9
12*3456+7-*8/+/9-

Evaluate this postfix expression:
24-36+387-*/+
1

Insert these letters into a BST:
"the quick brown fox"

Delete "T", "F", and "H" from the BST (in that order.)

Insert the word "lizard" into a 2-3 tree.

When would a "100 Tree" be a good idea?
When you need the tree to be as flat as possible; when you want to
minimize hard drive accesses

Write code for the Linked List "Exists" method. Assume there is a class variable self.mFirst.
def Exists(self, item):

Write code for the BST "Exists" method and its recursive counterpart.
