Final exam possible assignments

Filters
PPM -> [filter] -> PPM
including orange filter, grayscale, PPM operators, etc
* Edge detection filter: identify bright pixels with dim neighboring pixels
If the overall change in two neighboring pixels is high, make one output pixel bright
if they are similar, the produced output pixel is dim.

* Anti-aliasing: average neighboring pixels and smooth out sharp edges
First option - resize to quarter size, and average colors per 4-pixel block
Second option - similar to edge detection; use a block of 4 pixels to determine
one output pixel (located in the top-left corner of the block)

* Load input image 1 from the GUI and apply a filter, like grayscale
[inside createFractal() copy output image to input image 1?]

* New fractal type?

* HSV - change the hue but keep saturation
Hue - 0-360 on the color wheel, Saturation and Value - floats from 0 to 1
Convert RGB to HSV and vice versa
This lets you create RGB gradients, hue gradients, saturation gradients, etc

* Randomly selecting an "interesting" region on the plane
randomly select a handful of points and select the one with the highest 
escape value that still escapes, and zoom in on it

* "Zoom videos"
a stitched-together series of frames of a fractal zooming in
have the program spit out several frames that can be stitched together later
