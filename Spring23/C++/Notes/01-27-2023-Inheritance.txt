Inheritance

When a child class inherits attributes and methods from a parent

#include "Parent.h"

class Child: public Parent {
    public:
    // New methods etc
}

MULTIPLE HEADER FILES

In general, if a header file includes another header file, any
source file that includes the first header file must also include
the second header file.

This is because the preprocessor #include directive simply inserts
the contents of the included header file into the source file, so
any symbols declared in the included header file will not be
available unless the source file includes the header file directly.
